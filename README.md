Scoot is a tiny utility app that (will) provide fast, keyboard-driven control over the mouse pointer. Scoot lets you move your mouse cursor, click, and drag, all from the comfort of your keyboard.

* Scoot is experimental. Is it possible to craft a tool that's _actually_ efficient? Something that people will actually _want_ to use? This is going to take some trial and error.

* Scoot doesn't currently do much of anything. It's in the early proof of concept + prototyping stage.

* Scoot complements mouse-related accessibility tools that ship as part of MacOS, such as [Mouse Keys](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh27469/mac) and other [accessibility shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204434).
